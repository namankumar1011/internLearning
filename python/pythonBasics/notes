Python is a server side programming language developed by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It can be used in different platforms like windows, mac, linux, etc.
It has a very simple syntax to follow.
Latest and widely used version of python is python3.
Unlike other programming languages python does not use semicolons or brackets instead it uses a new line to complete the previous line.
Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
To run a python program go to terminal -> go to the storage path where you saved the program -> then write python nameOfTheFile.py
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.  
comments in python are provided with a "#" sign, it does not have a multiline comment
