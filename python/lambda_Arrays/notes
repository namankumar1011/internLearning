A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
syntax:
lambda arguments : expression
The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.
