Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.
The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,
Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
Any string is True, except empty strings.
Any number is True, except 0.
Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators: rest all are same except below two
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y

Assignment operators
Comparison operators consists of equal, not equal, greater, etc
Logical operators consists of and, or, not

Identity operators: Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
example:
is 	- Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
is not	- Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

Membership operators: Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
example:
in 	- Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
not in	- Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

Bitwise operators: consists of &,|,etc
