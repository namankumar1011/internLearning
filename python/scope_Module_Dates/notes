A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.
A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.
A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.
Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.

Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:
when using a function from a module, use the syntax: module_name.function_name.
You can create an alias when you import a module, by using the as keyword:

A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.

The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings.
The method is called strftime(), and takes one parameter, format, to specify the format of the returned string:
