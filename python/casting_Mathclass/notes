Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:

The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).

Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.
To use it, you must import the math module:
The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:
The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:
The math.pi constant, returns the value of PI (3.14...):
