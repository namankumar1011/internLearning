Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Variables names can include _, letters and alphabets.
Camel Case - Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter: example hiThere
Pascal Case - Each word starts with a capital letter: example -  HiThere
Snake Case - Each word is separated by an underscore character: example - hi_there
Unpack a Collection - If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
